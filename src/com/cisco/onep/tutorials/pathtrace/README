PathTrace Tutorial
------------------

Goal

PathTrace is a way of inspecting a group of onePK-enabled devices along the
route, or "path", between a pair of network devices. This tutorial is intended
for developers who wish to use the PathTrace service set.

Overview

To use PathTrace, a source and a destination node must first be specified,
which corresponds to a pair of PathTrace-enabled "initiator" and "responder"
devices, respectively. Nodes along the route connecting the two end nodes may
then be queried for a predefined profile and the responses are sent back to the
calling application.

Device Setup

In order to use the PathTrace service set, the following commands must be
issued on the end nodes. In this example, NE100 is the initiator and NE101 is
the responder.

+-----
NE100>enable
NE100#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
NE100(config)#onep
NE100(config-onep)#service set pathtrace 
NE100(config-onep)#exit
NE100(config)#mediatrace initiator source-ip 10.10.10.1
NE100(config)#end
+-----

+-----
NE101>enable
NE101#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
NE101(config)#mediatrace responder 
NE101(config)#end
+------

You are now ready to run the tutorial.

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/pathtrace/PathTraceTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.pathtrace.PathTraceTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
         -s <source node address> -d <destination node address> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to and source and destination node addresses
    correspond to the initiator and responder configured with mediatrace.
