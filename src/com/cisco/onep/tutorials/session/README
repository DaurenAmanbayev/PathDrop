Session Tutorial
----------------

This tutorial is intended for application developers who wish to have more
fine-grained control over the connections made between onePK applications
and network elements.

In onePK, a session represents an authenticated channel of communication
between an application and a network element. This tutorial will demonstrate
how to configure a session, how to get the properties and statistics of a
session, and how to reconnect to a disconnected session.

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/session/SessionTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.session.SessionTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
