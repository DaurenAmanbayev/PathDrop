Discovering onePK Services Tutorial
--------------------------

The Discovery tutorial was created to show how applications can connect
to a network element, and query for the list of services that network
element has available.  Information returned will be related to the base
and all optional service sets.  Detailed information such as version 
information are also returned.

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/discovery/DiscoveringOnePKServicesTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.discovery.DiscoveringOnePKServicesTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
