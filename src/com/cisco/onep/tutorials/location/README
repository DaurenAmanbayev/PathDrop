Location Tutorial
--------------------------

This tutorial will demonstrate the onePK Location Service Set. This tutorial
is intended to show the very basics of how to change, set, and remove
locations, filters, and event listeners.

At the beginning, this tutorial will connect to the Network Element. The
tutorial for connecting to a Network Element can be seen in the Session
Element tutorial. Next, this tutorial will add Civic Locations, Custom
Locations, and Geo Locations to both the Network Element and to the Interface
Ethernet 0/1. Next, this tutorial will add Location Change Event
Listeners to both the Network Element and to Ethernet 0/1 interface. Finally,
this tutorial will remove the listener and disconnect from the Network Element.

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/location/LocationTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.location.LocationTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
