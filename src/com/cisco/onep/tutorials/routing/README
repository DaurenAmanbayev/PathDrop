Routing Service Set Tutorial
--------------------------

This is the onePK Routing Service Set Tutorial in which the C Routing API is
demonstrated. The following program will first, establish a session with the
connecting Network Element (see Session Element Tutorial). Next, this program
will read the routes from the present RIB and display them to the user. Next,
this program will add and delete custom application routes to the Network
Element. The program will then add a listener so that it can receive up/down
route notifications in the RIB. Finally, this program will cleanup and
disconnect from the Network Element.

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/routing/RoutingTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.routing.RoutingTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
