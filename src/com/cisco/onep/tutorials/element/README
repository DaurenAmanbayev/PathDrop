Element Tutorial
--------------------------

The Element Service Set is the core device model for the onePK system. The network element
represents the hardware that hosts the network operating system and that provides network services
to onePK applications. The application connects to the network element and this connection
(session) is managed by the Element Service Set. Once the application has been authenticated
and authorized, it can access the network element information and other service sets.
Network Element information that the Element Service Set provides includes:

* Network element attributes such as address or license status
* Systems attributes such as memory and CPU usage

To build this tutorial:

    export CLASSPATH='onePK-sdk-<version>/java/lib/*:.'
    cd onePK-sdk-<version>/java/tutorials/src/main/java
    javac com/cisco/onep/tutorials/element/ElementTutorial.java

To run this tutorial:

    java \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path to keyStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keyStore password>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path to trustStore>] \
        [-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<trustStore password>] \
        com.cisco.onep.tutorials.element.ElementTutorial \
         -a <element address> -u <username> -p <password> \
        [-t <0=tls | 1=tcp>]

    Where username and password are configured on the network element
    you are connecting to.
